# ChallengeOne

## Description

In this challenge I was tasked with changing non-semantic HTML into semantic HTML for the purpose of increasing the accessibility of the webpage. In this challenge I also came across a few bugs and fixed them so the webpage operates as intended. For example changing some of the <!div> tags to <!nav> or <!section>, or adding the <!id> to a link to make it functional.
